So I focus on tasty, healthy meals that are simple and easy to make in a short time. I mostly use ingredients that are easy to find in any supermarket, and most of my recipes take less than 30 minutes to put on the table. I’ve lived in Japan for a short time and I’ve been influenced by the Japanese kitchen, with its emphasis on simplicity, and so I will include some Japanese recipes as well. The picture was taken at the Matsuo shrine in Kyoto. The vegetables are offerings to the Shinto deities.

All of these are actually very easy. Cooking rice Cooking rice is very easy. The basic rule is: use 2 cups water for 1 cup rice (for Basmati a little less than 2 cups, for Japanese rice it is 1.1 cup water for 1 cup rice). The cup I use is 200 ml. I wash the rice a few times to get rid of dust and also of the rice flour from polishing. To cook the 1 cup of rice in the microwave: Put the rice with the water in a microwave-compatible pot with a lid Cook at full power (900W) for one and a half minutes Cook at reduced power (40%, 360W) for 15 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes more time, about 25 minutes. Check if all the water is gone, if not give it another 5 minutes, then check again. To cook the 1 cup of rice on the hob: Put the rice with the water in pot with a lid Bring to the boil Cook over low heat for about 15-20 minutes. For basmati or Japanese rice this is enough; wholegrain rice takes about 25-30 minutes.

Cooking potatoes If you use the microwave, cooking potatoes is again very easy: Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them. You can either cook large potatoes whole or chop them up into small chunks. If you like them whole, pierce them several times with a fork. Put in the microwave at full power for about 10 minutes (for 500g potatoes). Check if they are ready by pricking with a fork or just tasting. If they are not ready, give it another 5 minutes, then check again. Wash the potatoes and cut out any eyes or damaged parts, but don’t peel them.

If they are not ready, give it another 5 minutes, then check again. You can of course cook them on the hob as well but the microwave is a better option, it is quicker and the cooked potatoes taste better too. Cooking pasta Pasta is one of the few foods that I do not cook in the microwave, because you need a large pot with plenty of water. My approach is a bit different from what most other people do, but again very easy: Bring 2 l of water to the boil with a bit of salt (say 1/2 tsp) When the water is boiling heavily, add the pasta (100 g per person) and stir until all the pasta is submerged. Cook for 3 minutes in heavily boiling water, without a lid. Take the pot off the hob, put the lid on and let it stand for the remainder of the time indicated on the package. For example if the cooking time on the package says 12 minutes (quite typical), then leave it for 9 minutes. Strain, sprinkle with some olive oil and serve.

The Condiment Starter Kit lists all the condiments you need for my recipes. The Survival Store lists the food items that I have in the cupboard because I use them a lot, but also so that I can cook up a meal in an emergency. And the Specialty Corner is a short list of the less common ingredients, mainly for Japanese food. The Condiment Starter Kit There are a few condiments that I use quite a lot. If you have these you can make all the recipes. Nuts and seeds are very tasty when roasted, and provide a very interesting texture as well. pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds sesame seeds walnuts cashew nuts pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds sesame seeds walnuts cashew nuts I use ginger and cumin in many of the recipes. Turmeric, coriander and cardamom are for the more curry-style recipes. fresh ginger cumin seeds turmeric coriander seeds cardamom pods fresh ginger cumin seeds turmeric coriander seeds cardamom pods Dried tomatoes are my favourite condiment because they add a lot of taste to the food and make it look nice too. Dried mushrooms are great for risottos and similar dishes. dried tomatoes (just dry, not in oil) dried mushrooms (porcini or mixed) olive oil soy sauce (make sure it is “real” soy sauce, made from soy, wheat and salt and nothing else) rice vinegar, wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar garlic oil, not essential but very nice! dried tomatoes (just dry, not in oil) dried mushrooms (porcini or mixed) olive oil soy sauce (make sure it is “real” soy sauce, made from soy, wheat and salt and nothing else) rice vinegar, wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar garlic oil, not essential but very nice!

They may be a bit harder to find in the supermarket: shichimi togarashi, a Japanese spice mixture. mirin, a sweet rice wine for cooking. miso paste, a paste made from salt and fermented soy beans, somewhat similar to vegetable stock cubes but much nicer. wakame seaweed, for use in stews and miso soup. konbu seaweed, for making dashi, the base for many Japanese dishes. hijiki seaweed, great for stews and salads. shichimi togarashi, a Japanese spice mixture. mirin, a sweet rice wine for cooking. miso paste, a paste made from salt and fermented soy beans, somewhat similar to vegetable stock cubes but much nicer. wakame seaweed, for use in stews and miso soup. konbu seaweed, for making dashi, the base for many Japanese dishes. hijiki seaweed, great for stews and salads.

I will regularly add recipes, follow me to get updates: The recipes will be organised in four categories: Quick recipes Emergency recipes Special occasion recipes Japanese recipes Quick recipes Emergency recipes Special occasion recipes Japanese recipes Most of the recipes will be in the “quick” category. The “emergency” recipes are recipes made only with ingredients from the store cupboard. The “special occasion” recipes are a bit more involved and take a bit longer to prepare. The Japanese recipes are usually quick but you need some Japanese ingredients. Quick recipes This is a very simple recipe with few ingredients and ready in about 20 minutes. Ingredients: 3 small courgettes (500 g) 1 pack gnocchi (500 g) brown breadcrumbs (1 cup) 50 g hard cheese (grana padano or parmezan), grated 1 tablespoon garlic oil 3 small courgettes (500 g) 1 pack gnocchi (500 g) brown breadcrumbs (1 cup) 50 g hard cheese (grana padano or parmezan), grated 1 tablespoon garlic oil Preparation: Slice the courgettes in half and scoop out the flesh. Put the scooped-out courgettes in a microwave dish. Cut the scooped-out flesh fine and mix with the breadcrumbs in another microwave dish. Put both dishes in the microwave at full power (900W). Cook for 5 minutes if together, for 3 minutes each if separately. Fill the courgette halves with the mixture. Sprinkle each of them with a little garlic oil and cover with the grated cheese. Cook the gnocchi: simply put them in boiling water until they float to the top (about 3 minutes). Meanwhile, cook the stuffed courgette halves in the microwave at full power (900W) for 3 minutes.

This very tasty recipe takes about 30 minutes to prepare, it’s a mild potato curry with a base of spices and seeds. The paneer (Indian fresh cheese, available in most supermarkets) is great when fried like this with sesame seeds and turmeric. I also make this recipe with chick peas instead, and prepare it in quite the same way. about 400 g small potatoes 2 large tomatoes about 200 g spinach 1 pack of paneer (about 200 g) 1 cm fresh ginger spices: turmeric, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom pods, cayenne pepper to taste (I use about a teaspoon of each of the spices and just a pinch of the cayenne pepper) seeds: sesame, sunflower, some pumpkin (I use about 1 table spoon of each) 1 table spoon of soy sauce oil for cooking (I use olive oil) optional: garlic oil about 400 g small potatoes 2 large tomatoes about 200 g spinach 1 pack of paneer (about 200 g) 1 cm fresh ginger spices: turmeric, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom pods, cayenne pepper to taste (I use about a teaspoon of each of the spices and just a pinch of the cayenne pepper) seeds: sesame, sunflower, some pumpkin (I use about 1 table spoon of each) 1 table spoon of soy sauce oil for cooking (I use olive oil) optional: garlic oil Wash the potatoes and cut them in two. Cook them in the microwave. Chop the tomatoes very fine. If you’re using whole seeds like I do, grind the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and cardamom pods. Chop the ginger very fine. Cut the paneer into cubes of about 1 cm on the side. Heat the oil in a large deep pan. I recommend a non-stick pan with a lid. When the oil is hot, add the ginger, seeds and spices and fry over medium heat for a few minutes. Add the paneer and stir until it is evenly covered with the seeds and spices. Fry for a few minutes more over medium heat, then turn up the heat for 30 seconds or so. Clear some space in the middle of the pan and put in the soy sauce. Stir vigorously. Add the tomatoes and stir well. Lower the heat and leave to simmer for a few minutes until the tomatoes have softened. You can speed this up by first putting the chopped tomatoes in the microwave for 2 minutes. Cook the spinach in the microwave at full power (900W) for 1 minute. Meanwhile, add the potatoes to the pan, stir until the potatoes are no longer looking white. Cut up the spinach. Add the spinach to the pan, stir and let simmer for a few more minutes. Add garlic oil to taste. Wash the potatoes and cut them in two. Cook them in the microwave. Chop the tomatoes very fine.

This is one of my favourite recipes, very easy to make, ready in 15 minutes and very tasty. You can also make this with courgettes instead of tomatoes. 4 large tomatoes 200-250 g halloumi cheese (1 pack) a handful of pumpkin seeds 1 cup of basmati rice, slightly less than 2 cups of water 4 large tomatoes 200-250 g halloumi cheese (1 pack) a handful of pumpkin seeds 1 cup of basmati rice, slightly less than 2 cups of water Cook the rice (see basics for how to cook rice). While the rice is cooking: Cut the tomatoes in half. Take a shallow dish with a lid, large enough to so that you can put the tomato halves next to one another. I use a heat resistant glass dish. Cut the halloumi in thin slices (2-3 mm) and cover the tomatoes with it. Sprinkle the pumpkin seeds on top. Put the lid on and put in the microwave for 5 minutes at full power (assuming a 900W microwave, Cat. E). Let it sit for 1-2 minutes, then cook for another 2 minutes at full power.
